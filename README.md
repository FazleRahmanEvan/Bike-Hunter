# I have created MongoDB as of myself for this project. I used plain CSS as well as Bootstrap & React Bootstrap.
# I used lots of components in client side with npm installation.
# In server side, any logged in user (by authentication: google or email & password) can add, delete.
# ImgBB(for image) & private route were used for the project.
# I had to make Email and password authentication by using react firebase hooks and also implemented Google sign in.
